Name of the NEMO-3.6 configuration to use for the run;
# i.e. your NEMO-3.6-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG/ configuration directory
config_name: SalishSea

# How is the domain to be distributed over the processors in the
# i (longitude) and j (latitude) directions?
# These values are used to set the nammpp namelist jpni & jpnj values
# and to set the number of processors and nodes in the PBS script
MPI decomposition: 1x7

# For runs on systems that use qsub/PBS/TORQUE
#
# The run_id value appears in the list of jobs display by the showq command
run_id: wcvi_attempt
# Maximum run time requested/allowed for job
# Too low and you job will be terminated before it finishes
# Too high and you will have to wait longer on the queue for your job to start
# You have to experiment to find the "just right" value
walltime: 1:00:00
# Email address to send job begin, end, and abort notifications to
# If missing, email address is set to ${USER}@eos.ubc.ca

paths:
  # Absolute path to NEMO-3.6 CONFIG/ directory.
  # You can use ~, $USER, $HOME if you wish.
  NEMO code config: /ocean/ssahu/CANYONS/nemo-3.6-code/NEMOGCM/CONFIG
  # If relative, paths below are taken from current directory
  # You can use ~, $USER, $HOME if you wish.
  XIOS: /ocean/ssahu/CANYONS/xios
  # Directory to use as base for relative paths in grid: and forcing: sections
  # below
  forcing: /ocean/ssahu/CANYONS/nemo-forcing
  # Directory in which to create temporary run directories
  # Typically NOT inside a version control repository

grid:
  # If relative, paths are taken from the grid/ directory in the forcing
  # path above
  coordinates: /ocean/ssahu/CANYONS/wcvi/grid/coordinates.nc
  bathymetry: /ocean/ssahu/CANYONS/wcvi/grid/bathy_meter.nc
  # Optional path/filename for land processor elimination MPI-LPE mapping
  # file that matches bathymetry;
  # If "land processor elimination:" key is absent or has the value "False",
  # land processor elimination is disabled

forcing:
  # The keys below are the names of symlinks that will be created.
  # The targets of those symlinks will be the paths named by the associated
  # "link to:" keys;
  # e.g. a symlink named NEMO-atmos will be created to
  # /results/forcing/atmospheric/GEM2.5/operational/
  #
  # The keys are directory names that you use as "cn_dir" values in your
  # namelists.
  #
  # You only need to include keys that are used in the namelist(s) for
  # your run.
  #
  # If relative, paths are taken from forcing path above

#restart:
  # The keys below are the names of symlinks that will be created.

namelists:
  # The namelist section files in the lists below will be concatenated
